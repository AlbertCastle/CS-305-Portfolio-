Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a company that is looking to be a little more modern in their technology, specifically their security. As we have learned throughout this course, financial institutions deal with very sensitive information from their clients and they wanted to add a layer of security that will give their clients peace of mind as they use the site from anywhere in the world. 


What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall well-being?
  It is important to code securely becuase attackers are going to always be looking for vulnerabilities within software, especially with a financial institution like the client, Artemis Financial. Through static testing I was able to detect vulnerabilites in this software. These are pictured in the document. 


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The dependency check tool was the most useful as it told me where the vulnerabilites were and how to fix them. Most of the issues came from outdate software that needed to be updated.


How did you approach the need to increase layers of security?
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
Like I stated above, most of the issues came from outdated libraries so updating these in the code will make the code more secure. In the future, using techniques such as penetration testing will give us a better idea of the vuulnerabilites in the software 


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Using the debugger is something that I have found useful throughout the courses in this program. Continually running the debugger gave me assurence that my program was running sucessfully. After I refactored my code, I ran another vulnerability check to see if there were no new vulnerabilites per the requirements. 


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Stackoverflow is a lifesaver somtimes when you get stuck on somthing, there are a lot of knowledgeable people out there and I hope to get there one day. 


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
The use of the hash fucntion to send the encrypted communications are something that is valuable to showcase.
